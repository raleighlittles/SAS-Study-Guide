# About

A collection of study materials for the [SAS Base Certification Exam](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/base-programmer.html) from my school's PSTAT 130 course.

# Table of Contents

This "study guide" contains 3 different types of training materials:

* **Exercises to the SAS book**: The end-of-chapter exercises from the SAS book (included in that directory).

* **Homework** : Contains 5 assignments, with a combination of multiple-choice and free response answers.

* **Section Exercises**: Contains assignments from several sections, that usually have around 2-3 free-response questions.


## Datasets

This directory contains all of the datasets that are needed to complete exercises -- if you see a dataset referenced by name in one of the exercises but there is no dataset in that directory, then see the `Datasets` directory.
